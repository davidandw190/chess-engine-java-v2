# Chess Engine in Java - V2 (work in progress..)

This project aims to revamp an older, somewhat janky chess engine written in Java that I developed half a year ago.

I like to think of this project as a continuation of my previous "chess engine" project from a year ago. With the experience gained since then and my newly acquired aptitudes in software engineering and OOP, I am excited to create a more robust and efficient chess engine, that is that provides a better user and developer experience.
